## Task 2 - The need for DFIR
1. What does DFIR stand for?<br>
    **Answer:** Digital Forensics and Incident Response

1. DFIR requires expertise in two fields. One of the fields is Digital Forensics. What is the other field?<br>
    **Answer:** Incident Response

## Task 3 - Basic concepts of DFIR
1. Complete the timeline creation exercise in the attached static site. What is the flag that you get after completion?
    Follow steps on the static website.<br>
    **Answer:** THM{DFIR_REPORT_DONE}

## Task 5 - The Incident Response process
1. At what stage of the IR process are disrupted services brought back online as they were before the incident?<br>
    > Recovery: Once the threat is removed from the network, the services that had been disrupted are brought back as they were before the incident happened.

    **Answer:** Recovery

1. At what stage of the IR process is the threat evicted from the network after performing the forensic analysis?<br>
    > Eradication: Next, the threat is eradicated from the network. It has to be ensured that a proper forensic analysis is performed and the threat is effectively contained before eradication. For example, if the entry point of the threat actor into the network is not plugged, the threat will not be effectively eradicated, and the actor can gain a foothold again.
    
    **Answer:** Eradication

1. What is the NIST-equivalent of the step called "Lessons learned" in the SANS process?<br>
    **Answer:** Post-incident Activity
