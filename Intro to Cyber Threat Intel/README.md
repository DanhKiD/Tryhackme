## Task 2 - Cyber Threat Intelligence
1. What does CTI stand for?<br>
    **Answer:** Cyber Threat Intelligence

1. IP addresses, Hashes and other threat artefacts would be found under which Threat Intelligence classification?<br>
    > Technical Intel: Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.

    **Answer:** Technical Intel

## Task 3 - CTI Lifecycle
1. At which phase of the lifecycle is data made usable through sorting, organising, correlation and presentation?<br>
    > Processing: Raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic usually come in different formats and may be disconnected when used to investigate an incident. This phase ensures that the data is extracted, sorted, organised, correlated with appropriate tags and presented visually in a usable and understandable format to the analysts. SIEMs are valuable tools for achieving this and allow quick parsing of data.
    **Answer:** Processing

1. During which phase do security analysts get the chance to define the questions to investigate incidents?<br>
    > Direction: This phase also allows security analysts to pose questions related to investigating incidents.

    **Answer:** Direction

## Task 4 - CTI Standards & Frameworks
1. What sharing models are supported by TAXII?<br>
    **Answer:** Collection and Channel

1. When an adversary has obtained access to a network and is extracting data, what phase of the kill chain are they on?<br>
    > Actions on Objectives: Fulfil the intended goals for the attack: financial gain, corporate espionage, and data exfiltration.

    **Answer:** Actions on Objectives

## Task 5 - Practical Analysis
1. What was the source email address?<br>
    > Email received by John Doe from vipivillain@badbank.com

    **Answer:** vipivillain@badbank.com

1. What was the name of the file downloaded?<br>
    > File download initiated by John Doe. File name: flbpfuh.exe

    **Answer:** flbpfuh.exe

1. After building the threat profile, what message do you receive?<br>
    **Answer:** THM{NOW_I_CAN_CTI}
