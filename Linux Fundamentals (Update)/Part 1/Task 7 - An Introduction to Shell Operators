1. If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?
Operator "&"
This operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, let's say we want to copy a large file. This will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies.

The "&" shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background (such as this file copy) allowing us to do other things!
#Flag: &

2. If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be?
#Flag: echo password123 > passwords

3. Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be
#Flag: echo tryhackme >> passwords
