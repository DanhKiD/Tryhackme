## Task 2 - What is Threat Emulation?
1. What can be defined as an intelligence-driven impersonation of real-world attacks?<br>
    > Threat emulation is an intelligence-driven impersonation of real-world attack scenarios and TTPs in a controlled environment to test, assess and improve an organisation's security defences and response capabilities.

    **Answer:** Threat Emulation

1. What is the exercise of representing adversary functions through predefined and automated attack patterns?<br>
    > Threat simulation commonly represents adversary functions or behaviour through predefined and automated attack patterns that pretend to represent an adversary. 

    **Answer:** threat simulation

## Task 3 - Emulation Methodologies
1. Under TIBER-EU, under which phase would Engagement and Scoping fall?<br>
    > Preparation Phase: During this phase, the security teams involved in the test are established, and the entity's management determines and approves the scope. This represents the formal launch of adversarial testing by ensuring all the planning and procurement processes are fulfilled.

    **Answer:** Preparation

1. What is the library that provides technical emulation tests based on TTPs?<br>
    > The Atomic Red Team is a library of emulation tests developed and curated by Red Canary that can be executed to test security defences within an organisation. The testing framework provides a mechanism for learning what malicious activities look like and provide telemetry from every test to facilitate defence improvements.

    **Answer:** Atomic Red Team

## Task 4 - Threat Emulation Process I
1. There's a set of 3 software used by FIN6 & FIN7. Can you identify them? Answers are in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.<br>
    Follow software header of [FIN6](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/) and [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/).<br>
    **Answer:** AdFind, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz

1. Which factor will be considered when analysing whether to use existing or custom tools during the emulation?<br>
    > TTP Complexity: Executing a fruitful emulation plan for complex adversaries who use sophisticated tools and procedures may take a long time. Here, we must establish whether existing tools can handle the emulation or whether custom ones are required.

    **Answer:** TTP Complexity

## Task 5 - Threat Emulation Process II
1. The emulation plan component determining which activities are to be conducted is known as the?<br>
    > Scope: The departments, users and devices upon which emulation activities are permitted should be defined explicitly.

    **Answer:** Scope

1. What is flag one obtained after completing the exercise?<br>
    **Answer:** THM{C4RB0N_$P1D3R_1$_F1N7}

1. What is flag two obtained after completing the exercise?<br>
    **Answer:** THM{3$P1ON4G3_F0R_R34P3R}

## Task 6 - Threat Emulation Process III
1.  What is flag three obtained after completing the exercise?<br>
    **Answer:** THM{D3F3NC3_1N_3MUL4T10N}

1. What is flag four obtained after completing the exercise?<br>
    **Answer:** THM{S3CUR3_4LL_W3B_4553T5}
